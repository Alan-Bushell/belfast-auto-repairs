## UX
### Pre-project Planning
>When deciding on this project I made a couple of point systems that ultimately lead me to this industry and the style at which I would try to create it.

I measured the following business types with a criteria out of 10 on a number of viable category's to determine what would be best to proceed.
A high score for portfolio would indicate more marketable when seeking future employment.
A high score for complexity would indicate a harder project but in turn also a good show of skill.
A high score for Time would indicate less time to actually create project.
A high score for Revenue Potential would indicate more potential work from servicing this market.


| Type | Portfolio-Weight| Complexity | Time to research | Rev Potential | Total Score:
|--|--|--|--|--|--|
|Services| 9 | 7 | 9 | 9 | 34 |
|Club| 8 | 7 | 8 | 8 | 31 |
|Small Biz| 9 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 33 |
|Specific Topic(historical or other)| 5 | 7 | 2 | 1 | 15 |

>From the above the best path forward & best for my growth would be to build a Service website.

At this stage I drilled down into the Service Industry and listed 8 different services provided and ranked them by 1 to 8, with 1 being the most interesting to me personally.

Here is how I established the ranking and also the options:

| No | Service Type | Rank |
|--|--|--|
|1| Accounting  | 8 |
|2| Personal Training | 3 |
|3| Plumber / Boiler Servicing | 2 | 
|4| Mechanic / Automotive  | 1 |
|5| Cakes / Baking | 7 |
|6| Entertainment ( Dj's, Bouncy Castles etc) | 6 |
|7| Landscaping  | 4 |
|8| Painting & Decorating | 5 |


This above preplanning helped me to determine the type of project & industry to build for.

# UX design

## Strategy Plane

### To determine the best approach to this project I started with to determine the user and business needs.

## User Stories

### User
> As a user I want to be able to find a mechanic in my local area to fix my car.  
> As a user I want to be able to contact the merchant online.  
> As a user I want to be able to request a quote online.  
> As a user I want to be able to see evidence of the merchants work & read testimonials as proof of work.  
> As a user I want to be able to find out when the business is open.

### Business Owner
> As the site owner I want to be able to showcase my business to prospective customers.  
> As the site owner I want to build trust and showcase details of my family run business and work completed.  
> As the site owner I want to create leads and provide customers a way to book in and/or request quotes.  
> As the site owner I want to use this website to attract more business from customers in and around Belfast. 
> As the site owner I want to show the user my business opening hours.   

## Scope Plane
> The website should have a Navigation menu that is consistent across all pages and devices.  
> The website should have a welcome message for the user explaining to them who we are and what we do.  
> The website should neatly and appropriatly list the services we provide to the user.  
> The website should give the user proof of work completed through testimonials and/or a portoflio of work done or in progress.  
> The website should give the user a way to contact the business for quotes or consultations through a form.  
> The website should give the user more contact methods including phone number and the physical address.  
> The website should include a map so the user can plan their route to the business. 
> The website should include opening hours for the user to view on all pages. 

## Structure Plane
> To acheieve the goals of the above the website should include at least 4 pages consisting of:  Home, About, Portfolio, Contact.  

**Home Page**
> Navigation with links  
> Hero welcome message with call to action to take user to contact form.  
> Service card section showcasing the many things that we can repair.
> Testimonials showcasing reviews and work completed from users of this business.
> Footer section with opening hours of the business along with links to the businesses social media pages.

**About**
> The about page should show a picture of the business owner.  
> The about page should explain any relevant information about the business in text format.  

**Portfolio**
> The portfolio page should show images in an organised responsive fashion showing proof of work complete or in progress. 

**Contact**
> The contact page should have a contact form for the user to get in touch or request quote.  
> The form should collect contact details for the customer so that the merchant can contact them back.
> The form should include an option for the user to select if they want to receive promotional offers and merchant collect e-mail addresses.
> The contact page should include multiple forms or contact including phone, address and a map of the business location.

## Skeleton Plane

### Home Page Desktop Wireframe

### Home Page mobile wireframe
![Home page mobile responsive Wireframe](assets/images/wireframes//wireframe2.png)

> The design flow in this website was meant to showcase a balanced minimal design that provided relevant information in a concise format on all devices.  
> As the project was created, the intial design did not provide the flow that was expected in the pre project stage. The project was then adapted to help with this during development.  
> The color theme was to be mainly using black and white for the base content with most additional color coming from overlays, images and as a background on the contact form.  

## Surface Plane

### Color
> I decided the best approach to this website was an attempt at minimilistic design with rare pops of colour. Most other websites of this industry had either gone for too much in terms of design or too little and just provide a very poor user experience.

> The decision was to stick with 

 - #fff - White
 - #000 - Black
And the occasional pop of color to finish on a modern design.
>Most additional color came through the images with the exception being the Hero Overlay and the Contact form.
>During the building of the project, some of the contact form did not have enough of a aspect ratio so I darkened the color to better suit users with visual impairment.

### Typography - 

>The font's chosen for this project were:

 - Roboto
 - Lato
> The rationale was that I wanted all of the information provided on the website to be clear, concise and without any unnecessary distractions. 
> My focus was to also assist with users who may have visual impairments

# Features Left to implement

### Home page
> In the future I would like to include a side element banner to promote special offers that the repair shop may want to offer from time to time.

>I would also like to make the service tiles as modals that onClick they would pop open with information about average issues, cost and duration it would take to fix. 
>I would like to add a carousel section to the testimonial cards that would auto move in a rotational basis and consist of about 5-8 different testimonials.

### About Page
> In the future I would like to add profiles to the about page with a breakdown of all the staff at the business. Including their name, image, what they specialize in and brief bio about themselves.

### Portfolio
> I would like to add a lightbox type gallery for these photos so that when a user clicks on them it will pop up and allow them to scroll through them as their leisure.
> I would also like to add side by side before and after photos. Ideally with a scroll option for the user to see the work done.

### Contact Us
>I have not developed a back end for the contact form and this would be high on my priority list to ensure that e-mails with booking requests are being sent both to the business & confirmation to the customer of what they requested.
>I would like to add a WhatsApp option or similar style contact method for business to allow customers to message the business for a more real-time response, whether that be for 24/7 breakdown or general queries
>I would also like to add call from browser to save the user having to copy and paste the phone number.

### Additional Page ideas
>I would add a careers page for potential young adults who would be interested in apprentices to submit their info.

>I would add a facility for users to actually book in, in a realtime booking system.
