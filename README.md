## UX
### Pre-project Planning
>When deciding on this project I made a couple of point systems that ultimately lead me to this industry and the style at which I would try to create it.

I measured the following business types with a criteria out of 10 on a number of viable category's to determine what would be best to proceed.
A high score for portfolio would indicate more marketable when seeking future employment.
A high score for complexity would indicate a harder project but in turn also a good show of skill.
A high score for Time would indicate less time to actually create project.
A high score for Revenue Potential would indicate more potential work from servicing this market.

| Type | Portfolio-Weight | Complexity | Time to research | Revenue Potential| Total Score: |
| Services | 9 | 7 | 9 | 9 | 34 |
| Club | 8 | 7 | 8 | 8 | 31 |
| Small Biz | 9 | 7 | 8 | 0 | 33 |
| Specific Topic(historical or other) | 5 | 7 | 2 | 1 | 15 |

>From the above the best path forward & best for my growth would be to build a Service website.

At this stage I drilled down into the Service Industry and listed 8 different services provided and ranked them by 1 to 8, with 1 being the most interesting to me personally.

Here is how I established the ranking and also the options:
1. Accounting - 8
2. Personal Training - 3
3. Plumber / Boiler Servicing - 2
4. Mechanic / Automotive - 1
5. Cakes / Baking - 7
6. Entertainment ( Dj's, Bouncy Castles etc) - 6
7. Landscaping - 4
8. Painting & Decorating - 5

This above preplanning helped me to determine the type of project & industry to build for.
