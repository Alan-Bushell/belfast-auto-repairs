## **Bugs**
Issues with centering content on the hero overlay
Parralax just did not help the flow of the page where I had orignally placed it. 
Decided to improve the flow of the page that the parralax would be better between the two content sections.
Original image just didnt fit the flow of the page nor the style of the page
Font awesome social media icons showing as squares even though the script link is in the head and icon tags are correct.(fixed)
Issue with footer content overlapping and not centering
issue with services overlapping on mobile. (fixed, was targetting wrong element container)
Contrast issue noted on lighthouse for the tag elements on the testimonials.(fixed, made colour darker and increased font size and weight).
Images not in correct aspect ratio. (removed placeholder images and downloaded them in the size needed.)
