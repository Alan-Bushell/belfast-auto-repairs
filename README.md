## **Bugs**
Issues with centering content on the hero overlay
Parralax just did not help the flow of the page where I had orignally placed it. 
Decided to improve the flow of the page that the parralax would be better between the two content sections.
Original image just didnt fit the flow of the page nor the style of the page
